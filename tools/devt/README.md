# 🛠️ **devt — Branded Task Lifecycle & Git Automation Module**

`devt` is an artisan-grade, self-contained PowerShell utility module built specifically for **StaticCanvas** projects. It automates development workflows by bridging local, file-based Markdown task tracking with remote GitLab work items, milestones, and Conventional Commits.

## **Why It Was Created**

1. **Context Capsule Efficiency**: Large project task lists consume significant AI context tokens. `devt` compiles a comprehensive task source file into a compact, pending-only task list to keep AI processing speeds high and token usage low.
2. **Local-First Source of Truth (SOT)**: Keeps the task list in plain Markdown committed to Git, avoiding heavy project management web app overhead while retaining full version control history.
3. **Automation Bridge**: Automates Git conventional commits, branch diffing, and two-way status/comment syncing with GitLab issues, milestones, and Merge Requests.

---

## **File Lifecycle Architecture**

`devt` manages tasks across three canonical files in the repository root:

*   **`devtracker-source.md`**: The local Source of Truth (SOT) containing all active tasks, historical notes, and completed records.
*   **`devtracker-pending.md`**: The compiled active task list. Completed items are filtered out to keep it lightweight for AI agents.
*   **`devtracker-archive.md`**: Permanent archival file for completed tasks that have been pruned from the active source.

## **Directory Structure**

The module is structured according to clean PowerShell automation standards:

```text
tools/devt/
├── devt.psd1                         # Module manifest defining exports and metadata
├── devt.psm1                         # Root module loader (sources all scripts dynamically)
├── README.md                         # Documentation (this file)
├── Public/
│   └── Invoke-Devt.ps1               # Main cmdlet orchestrator (aliased to 'devt')
└── Private/
    ├── Get-ConventionalCommitVersion.ps1 # Tag-anchored conventional commits versioning engine
    ├── GitLabSync.ps1                # GitLab REST API interaction & MR generation
    ├── GitOps.ps1                    # Conventional Commit helper & diff formatting
    ├── Helpers.ps1                   # Text parsers, dynamic root resolution & validators
    ├── New-AsciiColor.ps1            # Standard terminal color helper
    ├── New-AsciiGradient.ps1         # Native ANSI 256-color gradient generator
    └── lazylog.ps1                   # Structured execution logger
```

## **Execution Modes**

The primary cmdlet is `Invoke-Devt` (aliased to `devt`). You can execute it with the `-Mode` parameter:

```powershell
devt -Mode <mode-name> [options]
```

### **Available Modes**

| Mode | Alias | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`init`** | - | Prepares a fresh `devtracker-source.md` template file or copies an existing pending file. |
| **`compile`** | `comp` | Filters and compiles active tasks from the source file into `devtracker-pending.md`. |
| **`sync`** | - | Merges completed task checkmarks and developer notes from the pending file back into the source file. |
| **`prune`** | - | Moves completed tasks from the source file to `devtracker-archive.md`. |
| **`stats`** | - | Renders a high-fidelity terminal dashboard with task metrics and progress bars using ANSI gradients. |

| **`add`** | - | Formats and appends a new task line to the source tracker. |
| **`remove`** | `rm` | Deletes a task from the source file matching a search key. |
| **`validate`** | - | Audits the source task list to ensure it conforms to the canonical emoji and category formatting. |
| **`sync-gitlab`** | - | Performs two-way synchronization between local tasks and GitLab issues & milestones. |
| **`commit`** | - | Prompts for Conventional Commit metadata and commits staged changes. |
| **`diff`** | - | Renders a styled summary of staged/unstaged changes. |
| **`branches`** | - | Renders a terminal comparison dashboard of local repository branches using concurrent processes. |
| **`gitdiff`** | - | Shows structured code differences between the current branch and a compare branch. |
| **`changelog`** | - | Automatically generates/compiles `CHANGELOG.md` from git conventional commit history. |

## **Task Format Conventions**

To be parsed and validated correctly by `devt`, task lines in the Markdown files must conform to the following schema:

```markdown
- [ ] <difficulty><scope>[status][priority] **Category/SubCategory** - Task Description
```

### **Metadata Emojis**

*   **Difficulty**: `🟢` (Very Easy), `🟡` (Easy), `🟠` (Moderate), `🔴` (Very High)
*   **Scope**: `💡` (Concept), `🌟` (Feature), `🦀` (Active Bug), `🪲` (Resolved Bug), `🩹` (Fix)
*   **Status**: `✔️` (Partially Complete), `❓` (Working with Issues), `✅` (Verified Complete), `🌀` (Work in Progress)
*   **Priority**: Keycap digits `0️⃣` to `🔟`

*Example:*
```markdown
- [ ] 🟠🌟🌀 **CLI/TaskTracker** - Implement GitLab sync logic
```

## **Technical Implementation Details**

### **1. Dynamic Git Root Resolution**
To ensure `devt` remains fully reusable and independent of the folder path in which it is installed, the module resolves the repository root dynamically by walking up the directory tree from the module's location until it locates a `.git` directory. If none is found, it falls back to three directory levels above the helper directory.

### **2. Version Engine: `Get-ConventionalCommitVersion`**
`devt` integrates the `Get-ConventionalCommitVersion` engine to calculate project semantic versions (SemVer). 
*   **Tag-Anchored Analysis**: The engine locates the most recent Git tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`) to establish a version baseline, scanning only the commit logs generated since that tag.
*   **Fallback Scanning**: If no tags are found in the repository history, the engine scans the full repository history starting from `0.1.0`.
*   **Commit Parsing**: It inspects subject lines for conventional types (`feat` minor bump, `fix` or `perf` patch bump) and checks commit bodies for `BREAKING CHANGE:` keywords to trigger major version bumps.

### **3. GitLab Auto-Authentication**
`devt` automatically extracts the credentials needed for the GitLab REST API by parsing the repository's Git remote origin URL:
```text
https://username:token@gitlab.com/namespace/project.git
```
This avoids hardcoding or maintaining separate environment configuration files, enabling secure API interactions for `sync-gitlab` and `create-mr` commands.

### **4. Concurrent Branch Status (RunspacePool)**
The `branches` execution mode evaluates all local branch relationships compared to the base branch (`develop` or `main`/`master`) in parallel. By utilizing a PowerShell `RunspacePool`, it runs background git calls concurrently to output the ahead/behind count, age, and last message in seconds, even for repositories with large counts of branches.

### **5. High-Performance .NET Disk I/O**
The module is designed with high-performance .NET classes under the hood:
*   Utilizes `[System.IO.File]` and `[System.IO.Path]` for direct disk I/O, bypassing slow PowerShell disk cmdlets.
*   Implements `[System.Text.StringBuilder]` for layout compiling to minimize memory allocation.
*   Uses `[System.Collections.Generic.List[type]]` for in-memory collections.

## **How to Setup & Use**

### **Installation**

1. Copy the `tools/devt` directory into your target repository.
2. In the target repository root, create an entry script named `devt.ps1` (or add an alias to your shell profile):
   ```powershell
   #!/usr/bin/env pwsh
   $scriptPath = [System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName($MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path)
   Import-Module ([System.IO.Path]::Combine($scriptPath, "tools/devt/devt.psd1")) -Force
   Invoke-Devt @args
   ```
3. Create a bash wrapper in the root named `devt` to allow easy Unix execution:
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
   pwsh -File "$SCRIPT_DIR/devt.ps1" "$@"
   ```
4. Initialize the task structure:
   ```bash
   ./devt init
   ```
5. Update `devtracker-source.md` with your repository-specific tasks.

### **Common Workflow Commands**

*   **View Dashboard**:
    ```bash
    ./devt stats
    ```
*   **Add a Task**:
    ```bash
    ./devt add -TaskText "Explore custom Liquid tags to simplify asset resolution" -Category "Features/Liquid" -Difficulty "easy" -Scope "feature"
    ```
*   **Compile Tasklist for AI agent**:
    ```bash
    ./devt compile
    ```
*   **Sync GitLab remote tasks**:
    ```bash
    ./devt sync-gitlab
    ```
*   **Commit staged files**:
    ```bash
    ./devt commit
    ```
